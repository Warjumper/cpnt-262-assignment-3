- Vue (outside of tutorials) has proved to be challenging and quite confusing for me, so more work will need to be done if I am to grasp it fully.
- I ran into problems exporting and importing from different parent/child components and views. Part of the problem for me was dealing with all the default things that I imported when creating the vue project in the first place. I will try to remedy this in the future.
